Battle Buddy is a work in progress tool for MMORPG's.
The goal of the project is to create a tool which can
display every possible stat of the player versus a target.
It is also intended to apply Theory Craft formulas to
calculate different builds and optimum efficiencies.
For example, Damage Per Second before and after mitigations
with accounting for critical chance/damage, rotations and the
target's resistance.

This is done in real time by reading the ram of the targeted
game to gather data as accurately as possible.

Currently the program is a command-line application, meaning
must be ran in a DOS prompt. However, as it progresses, it
will become a GUI form. With the potential of becoming a
DirectX or GDI overlay.

It is currently being written in the scripting language
AutoIT for ease of use and fast updates. This also allows it
to be adapted to meet the end user's needs with little effort.

The following command is used to compile the application:
